    <p> 
        &nbsp&nbspWhen I was small I wanted to become an ANSTRONAUNT because, my elder
        sister said I would be able to collect moon rocks and bring to earth where
        I and her will sell it in her company we would build together
        (that is all my parents children).
    </p>
    <p>
        &nbsp&nbspAs I grew up, it seemed things weren`t looking at the side of 
        space exploration (as for my part of my world) then my sister came and 
        of Marine Engineering then, I looked forward to becoming a marine Engineer
        . I ran with that until I got to primary 5.

        &nbsp&nbspMy mom help in shaping my present dream in a way that she didn`t think of
        (although she also shape me In other way in chosing the career course I 
        want to study (that is teaching me how to pray and many more), she took
        I and my immediate elder sister to a cyber cafe where we could learn the 
        basis of computer.
    <p>
        &nbsp&nbspThis made me change my mind to become a computer scientist and I
        <strong>loved</strong> the idea very much, always wanted to use a compter
        because, when i watched movies the way poeple type made me <mark>love
         using a computer</mark>

       &nbsp&nbspUntil I got to JSS3 where I had interest in 
       Mechatronics Engineering but, I mistook it for Robotics Engineering.
       In SS1 I finally got to understand to difference between 
       <mark>Robotics</mark> and <mark>Mechatronics</mark>, and so I started learning HTML with 
        the aid of my dad`s laptop and I have made meaningful progress
